## Terminology

### Topics
I topic is the main entry point into your application. All your conversaions start within a topic depending on what exactly was said the first topic could vary. SuperScript will continue to seatch topics until it finds a matching Gambit, then replies.

### Gambits
A Gambit is a piece of information, in SuperScript it contains two parts an input and one or more replies. The input is the basis of the trigger that we match on.

### Reply
This is what is said back to the user, and is the part of a Gambit. A reply can also have a series of Gambits attached to them thus creating a thread of conversation.
